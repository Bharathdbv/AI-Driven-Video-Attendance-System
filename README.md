# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python and Tkinter for the graphical interface. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces, updating attendance records in real-time. It provides various functionalities including managing student details, training face data, and browsing images.

## Features
- **Student Details Management:** Allows users to manage student information.
- **Face Data Training:** Enables the training of face data for recognition.
- **Real-time Attendance Update:** Automatically updates attendance records based on face recognition.
- **Image Browsing:** Provides the ability to browse images for reference or verification purposes.
